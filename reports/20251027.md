## Individual Contributions

### Daniel Petkau
**Last Week’s Goals:**
Implement declarativeNetRequest rules - 4 days
**Progress and Issues:** Preliminary cookie blocking logic done
- **Issues/Blockers:** I found that it’s harder than I thought to verify that cookies are being properly blocked
- **Learnings:** I now know about Playwright, which is a way to simulate browsing and verify that cookies are being properly blocked
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** Help add functionality to unfinished whitelist system, set up github actions to automatically run tests

### Shaan Kumar
**Last Week’s Goals:**
Test banner detection, finish popup/dashboard, begin UI & background wiring and storage.
**Progress and Issues:**
**Progress made:* *Built popup and dashboard and semi-functional dashboard; tried banner detection on multiple sites; started UI, background, and storage messaging.
**Issues/Blockers:** CSS polish took time; popup is a bit tall; banner detection isn’t inconsistent; message/ storage flow needs fixing.
**Learnings:** Practiced UI/UX tuning and Chrome messaging patterns.
**Plans and Goals for Next Week:**
Finalize reliable UI, background, storage flow.


Improve banner detection and “Essentials Only” auto-click.


Tighten UI (shorter popup, cleaner styling) and align behavior with spec.

### Dave Guo
**Last Week’s Goals:**
- Implement declarativeNetRequest rules
**Learnings: better understanding on chrome background service **
- **Progress made**: Finished, there is a working extension on the github
- **Issues/Blockers:** None
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:**
- Connect UI to the background script 

### Salim Moshe
** Last Week’s Goals:**
Implement declarativeNetRequest rules and test banner detection
**Progress made:** Implemented the cookie blocking logic with declarativeNetRequest, integrated banner handling that automatically selects “Essentials Only” or “Deny,” and connected background logic with popup messaging.
**Issues/Blockers:** Some websites malfunctioned when all cookies were blocked, so I adjusted the logic to keep essential cookies allowed.
**Learnings:** Learned how to use chrome.storage.sync for persistent state, manage background and content script communication, and handle service worker events effectively.
**Plans and Goals for Next Week:**
Connect the UI with background logic - 1 day
Verify whitelist and blacklist storage integration - 1 day
Begin testing overall cookie blocking and banner removal flow - 2 days

### David Montiel
**Last Week’s Goals:**
Creating a more functional/realistic dashboard with slight testing of capabilities.
- **Progress made**: Mostly finished, the group was able to make a semi functional dashboard not perfect though.
- **Issues/Blockers:** Took a bit of time to make the components look appealing, and there was just overall some learning time needed with CSS. Banner blocker works on some sites but not all. 
- **Learnings:** Better understanding of UI designs when it comes to realistic user usage
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:**
- Connect frontend to backend, overall trying to make the extension more realistically functional according to the spec. 


### Aryan Verma
**Last Week’s Goals:**
We tested the banner detection with our mockup UI
**Progress made**: We made the popup and dashboard.
**Issues/Blockers:** Some issues figuring out the CSS components to make the interface look clean to look at and the popup may be a bit too long. The banner detection also doesn’t fully work as of now.
**Learnings:** Better understanding of UI design and how we can make it user friendly.
**Plans and Goals for Next Week:**
Connect UI to the background script so that the when the UI sends a message to the background script, the background script can correctly receive it, update it’s storage, and sends a reply.
