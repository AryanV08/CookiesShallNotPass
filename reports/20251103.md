- **Issues/Blockers:** Had trouble getting cookies blocked on some sites  
- **Additional work:** Looked into importing files for blacklist/whitelist  

### Plans and Goals for Next Week:

## Individual Contributions

### Daniel Petkau
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Help with whitelist system, set up github actions to automatically run tests  
- **Progress and Issues:** Github actions is set up to automatically run tests, whitelist system is working  
- **Issues/Blockers:** None  
- **Learnings:** I’ve never used github actions before, I thought it would be diifficult to set up but it turns out they have presets for different types of projects that only needed to be slightly modified.  
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** Make sure tests properly demonstrate working cookie blocking  

### Shaan Kumar
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Finalize reliable UI, background, and storage flow. Improve banner detection and “Essentials Only” auto-click. Tighten UI (shorter popup, cleaner styling) and align behavior with spec.  
- **Progress and Issues:**  
  - **Progress made:** Completed wiring between UI, background, and storage so the dashboard reflects live data. Improved banner detection logic and tested “Essentials Only” auto-click on multiple sites. Refined popup layout to be shorter and more consistent with spec.  
  - **Issues/Blockers:** Some banner detection cases remain inconsistent across sites. Minor CSS adjustments still needed to polish the dashboard.  
- **Learnings:** Gained deeper understanding of Chrome’s messaging flow and how to align UI/UX polish with functional requirements.  
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:**
- Finalize the dashboard with Aryan and David. Once done, conduct peer testing to validate usability and reliability.
- Complete report bug feature on dashboard.

### Dave Guo
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Connect UI to the background script  
- **Progress made:** Finished, there is a working extension on the github  
- **Issues/Blockers:** None  
- **Learnings:** better understanding on chrome API  
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** Write more tests for the extension  

### Salim Moshe
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Connect the UI with background logic. Verify whitelist and blacklist storage integration. Begin testing overall cookie blocking and banner removal flow  
- **Progress made:** Successfully connected the UI to the background logic, enabling smooth communication between the user interface and core functionalities. Verified the integration of the whitelist and blacklist storage, ensuring domains are correctly added and removed as expected. Began testing the cookie blocking.  
- **Issues/Blockers:** Cookie blocking logic is still not fully resolved, some websites bypass blocking, especially those using more sophisticated tracking methods.  
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:**  
  - Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly (2 days)  
  - Clean up the code for better readability and maintainability (1 day)  
  - Focus on resolving the cookie blocking logic, specifically targeting edge cases where it fails (2 days)  

### David Montiel
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Connecting the front end to the backend and adding functionality from the spec  
- **Progress made:** A good amount of work got done, changed the UI layout to a more common/eye-appealing layout. Connected the frontend to the backend.  
- **Issues/Blockers:** Formatting was a pain, but also currently blocked on cookie blocking logic, works then doesn't, trying to untangle logic currently  
- **Learnings:** Better understanding of UI designs when it comes to realistic user usage  
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** We need to fix the cookie and banner logic to the point it's reliable enough for peer testing and feedback  

### Aryan Verma
- **Last Week’s Goals:** We connected UI ↔ background; verified whitelist/blacklist storage  
- **Progress made:** Added features that shows the whitelist and blacklist in the dashboard as well as made nice looking counters for how many cookies are blocked.  
- **Issues/Blockers:** Some issues were making the window popup look just the right size as it was getting bigger.  
- **Learnings:** Better understanding of using CSS and HTML to make extension look good.  
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** Finalizing the dashboard and peer testing.
