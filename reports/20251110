# Weekly Status Report
- **Date:** 11/9/25  
- **Team:** CookiesShallNotPass  
- **Project:** Chrome cookie blocking extension  

## Team Report
### Last Week’s Goals:
Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly. Clean up the code for better readability and maintainability. Focus on resolving the cookie blocking logic, specifically targeting edge cases where it fails.
### Progress and Issues:
**Task 1: Cookie Blocking Logic**  
- **Progress made:** We successfully updated the logic for determining whether a cookie is essential. Cleaned up and commented the code for better readability and maintainability. The UI was successfully connected to the background logic. Started testing the updated cookie blocking logic.
- **Learnings:** Improved understanding of the intricacies involved in managing cookies and implementing logic that works across various sites.
- **Issues/Blockers:** Some websites are still bypassing the blocking logic, particularly those using advanced tracking methods.  
- **Additional work:** We made progress with testing, including additional tests for cookie blocking functionality.

### Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- **Task/Feature 1** – Assigned to Aryan, Shaan, David – Add more data visualizations to the dashboard, finish the import/export functionality for cookie lists. 
- **Task/Feature 2** – Assigned to Daniel, Dave and Salim – Focus on resolving edge cases in cookie blocking, Implement the logic for storing cookies blocked by each domain, testing.

## Individual Contributions

### Daniel Petkau
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Make sure tests properly demonstrate working cookie blockers
- **Progress and Issues:** Done, test show working cookie blocking. We also showed it works in our demo
- **Issues/Blockers:** The cookies sometimes have a delay before being blocked, we aren’t sure if we can fix that.
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** Add more statistics gathering for the frontend UI team to use.


### Shaan Kumar
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Finalize the dashboard with Aryan and David. Once done, conduct peer testing to validate usability and reliability. Complete report bug & source code support feature on dashboard.
- **Progress and Issues:**  
  - **Progress made:** Worked with Aryan and David to finalize dashboard features including improved whitelist/blacklist tracking and updated counters; integrated reporting and source code support; conducted peer testing to validate usability and reliability.
  - **Issues/Blockers:** Counters were inconsistent due to backend–frontend synchronization challenges; verifying cookie blocking data representation required extra refinement.
- **Learnings:** Better understanding of backend synchronization and its impact on analytics
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** Continue refining counters to ensure backend and frontend sync; improve analytics section of the dashboard for clearer cookie activity insights; enhance overall user experience with consistent, accurate data display, and finish import/export feature. 


### Dave Guo
- **Last Week’s Goals:**Write more tests for the extension  
- **Progress made:** added 19 tests  
- **Issues/Blockers:** None  
- **Learnings:** better understanding on chrome API  
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** Add data visuals to the dashboard for better insight into cookie activity.


### Salim Moshe
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly. Clean up the code for better readability and maintainability. Focus on resolving the cookie blocking logic, specifically targeting edge cases where it fails.
 - **Progress made:** Successfully updated the logic for determining whether a cookie is essential or not. Cleaned up and commented the code for improved readability and maintainability. Began testing the updated cookie blocking logic.
- **Issues/Blockers:** Some websites still bypass the cookie blocking, especially those using more sophisticated tracking methods.
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:**  
  - Implement the logic for storing cookies blocked by each domain and track the frequency of blocked or allowed cookies (2 days)
  - Improve banner detection and removal logic (2 days)
  - Assist with the import and export functionality for cookie lists (1 day)


### David Montiel
- **Last Week’s Goals:** Fixing cookie blocking logic to the point it's reliable enough for beta/peer testing.
- **Progress made:** Definitely managed to get it improved to work for the beta, needs refinement from the hardcoded approach. It will be implemented soon.
- **Issues/Blockers:** Verifying if the extension was actually blocking was a pain because numbers were inconsistent, and only worked under certain conditions. 
- **Learnings:** Learned more about how to properly implement cookie blocking   
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** I plan on working on the data analytics, adding a new section to the dashboard with bars, etc, to display cookies being blocked vs not, etc, overall making our UI not as dead. 


### Aryan Verma
- **Last Week’s Goals:**  Finalizing the dashboard and peer testing. 
- **Progress made:** Added features that better track the whitelist and blacklist in the dashboard and updated counters so they aren’t duplicated.
- **Issues/Blockers:** Some issues were making sure the counter from the backend was accurate to the frontend as that was difficult in having that synchronization.
- **Learnings:** Better understanding of how the counters work for the analytics section.
- **Plans and Goals for Next Week:** I plan to continue working on the counters as they still aren’t as accurate as they can be so I will try to look on the backend side and make sure everything is getting synced properly so when we open the extension, the counter looks a lot better.
